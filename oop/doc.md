- Inheritance: child classes inherit data and behaviors from parent class
- Encapsulation: containing information in an object, exposing only selected information
- Abstraction: only exposing high level public methods for accessing an object
- Polymorphism: many methods can do the same task

### Types of polymorphism

- Static Binding (or Compile time) Polymorphism, e.g., Method Overloading
- Dynamic Binding (or Runtime) Polymorphism, e.g., Method overriding
